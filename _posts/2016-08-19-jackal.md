Jackal's fully integrated, weatherproof design offers unique capability in a compact package. Jackal was unveiled at [IROS 2014](http://www.iros2014.org/), and is shipping as of late 2014.

Jackal includes an integrated PC running Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo. To install the software on your control computer, first ensure that you are using Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS, and have [ROS Indigo](indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) installed.
