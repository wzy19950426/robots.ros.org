PMB-2 is an indoor mobile robot designed with minimum footprint and maximum
payload in mind. Its primary sensors are a laser range finder and an IMU, but
optional additions include ultrasound sensors and microphones. PMB-2 features
built-in speakers so the robot can inform its surroundings of the completion of
a task or ask you to rescue it from under a pile of objects. It also has
already developed software for navigation. This robot runs on ROS Hydro
internally, and uses state-of-the-art ros_control components.
